# mike here.. i like where you were going with this, and will adopt a lot of your todo list..
#its ambitious.. but i also need a tool that works from day to day so we'll see what happens

#todo, structure explorer should field should allow for field entry
to replace the parsed structure values


crash in undo stack
widget should be usable on its own
import export patch from undostack
undo for addSelection
jupyter optional

behaviour bugs:
	should overwrite highlighted text when selected (this is more a bug in the undo system at this point)
	undo's should select the new data
    recent files are mis ordered, doesnt really handle a user opening the same file twice

   
things best done as plugins:
   - intel hex (with sparse support)
	** TODO bitmap view
	** TODO import / export
	keystone assembler
	binary diff



things that probably wont happen but i keep to remind me
   - make everything configurable
     - font
     - address view (hex / dec / oct / off, length, ...)
     - data view (hex / dec / oct / bin, grouping, separator lines, bytes per line, ...)
	** TODO view as hex/oct/dec/bin?
  - maybe include hexview widget for search term input?


** TODO rich status bar information
   - progress bar for long operations (search, parse, ...)
   - insert / overwrite mode,  read-write / read-only, charset,

** TODO better search dialog
   - ascii / hex / numbers / number ranges / regex
   - "find all" option
   - select matching bytes
   - replace option
   - distribution map for search results?
   - save result regions as selection
   
** TODO diff files and regions
   - beyondcompare-like context menu: "select left side to compare"...

   
** TODO Jump to address for values that are also valid 32bit addresses - started


   
** TODO allow syncrhonized scrolling in multiple buffers - good idea added a checkbox to sync checked windows
