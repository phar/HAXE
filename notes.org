# mike here.. i like where you were going with this, and will adopt a lot of your todo list..
#its ambitious.. but i also need a tool that works from day to day so we'll see what happens

#todo, structure explorer should field should allow for field entry
to replace the parsed structure values


change hilight cololor between ascii and hex sides depending on which selection is active
confirm safe
confirm large file mode
plugin scripts
structure at location
re-add virtical lines in hex view
structure @ address
* missing features



   

** TODO rich status bar information
   - progress bar for long operations (search, parse, ...)
   - insert / overwrite mode,  read-write / read-only, charset,
   - file length / selection length / cursor position
   - value at cursor in dec / hex / bin
   - ...
** TODO better search dialog
   - ascii / hex / numbers / number ranges / regex
   - "find all" option
   - give region to search in (selection, start+length, start+end, whole buffer)
   - select matching bytes
   - replace option
   - maybe include hexview widget for search term input?
   - distribution map for search results?
   - highlight search results
   - save result regions as selection
** TODO diff files and regions
   - beyondcompare-like context menu: "select left side to compare"...

** TODO file explorer

** TODO regex builder?
** TODO bookmarks / favourites
** TODO tabbed interface for multiple open files
** TODO open disk / process / partial files
   - specify offset & length when opening a file
   - add choice to mmap the file instead of reading it into ram
** TODO import / export
   - intel hex (with sparse support)
   - ...
** TODO undo tree like emacs
   - maybe use graphview widget for undo tree display?
** TODO rectangle selection mode?

** TODO bitmap view

** TODO Jump to address for values that are also valid 32bit addresses - started

** TODO multiple views for same file - i can kind of support this now.. not sure how it will work out workflow wise

** TODO view as hex/oct/dec/bin?


** TODO keep sparse space at the end
   - automatically growing as it fills up?
   - will help displaying a new (empty) buffer
   
** TODO allow syncrhonized scrolling in multiple buffers - good idea added a checkbox to sync checked windows

* user interface
** selection
   - selection possibility on right side
   - boxes around selection or parsed structs? so that content can be color coded
   
** display
   - make everything configurable
     - font
     - address view (hex / dec / oct / off, length, ...)
     - data view (hex / dec / oct / bin, grouping, separator lines, bytes per line, ...)
     - ascii view (



#probably wont do the ones below these, its python, you dan do them yourself with the API
** TODO disassembler
   - see pure python disassemblers from vivisect
   - also include assembler?
   - maybe even search / replace for asm?
   
   ** look at python libs for binary parsing
   - pyelftools
     is actually construct based
   - pefile
     uses 'struct'
   - ...
